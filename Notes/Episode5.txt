1. What is VDOM can we see????: YES, VDOM is Object representation of Real Dom. We can see Actual/Real Dom in the browser element or our <div> elements.
And We can see VDOM by Console.log(<Header/>) or any component. its print the object representation in the console, that representation the react created using 
React.createElement("h1", { }, {}) . like this.


2. Reconsilation Process or React Fiber ???? this is the process of updating the dom using diffing algorithm . 
What Diff algorithm do is comparing the Old VDOM and New VDOM and finds outs the diff and returns the updated dom and then Updates the 
real dom. 

Comparing the old dom to new dom and then updating the real dom that all process is called Reconsilation process / React Fiber. that comes in React 16.

React Fiber: Its a new way of finding the diff and updating the dom. comes in 16 version. 


3. Why React is Fast??? Because React Does  Efficient DOM manipulation. Because its have a VDOM. React runs algorithms on VDOM and efficiently Update the Real DOM.

4. Is VDOM is for React or VDOM comes with React ???? NOOOO, VDOM is exists a long back. Its just a javascript object representation of RDOM. BUT Its popular when React comes.
React Took that and build core alogorithm over that.

SOOOO, React Find out the Diff Between VDOM and update the UI. Thats the core of react.

5. Diff algo makes the Data and UI in a sync by updating the ui when founds the changes in between doms.

6. incremental rendering??? the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.
